Prerequisites to setup the project: 
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed (version 16 or higher) 
2. Initialize the repository by running the following command inside of it:

> npm install

3. Build / translate given source code in `src` by running 
> npm run build

4. After previous step has completed a `built` folder will appear or get updated with fresh translation of `src`'s folder code.

5. (Optional) you can watch for code changes by running command below, which will update your built folder on each change inside `src` folder.

>npm run watch 


6. Execute program entry point by running 

> npm start

7. Last but not least, remember to use linter (and fix its complaints) before pushing changes to origin. 

> npm run lint
